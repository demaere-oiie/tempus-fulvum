# tempus-fulvum

Back when I first got Windows 3.0, in the last century, I had a program running to change my window background colors according to local time, so I'd know when to stop working, saying to myself something like "Oh, blue-past orange, time to go home..."

This is a more traditional, less dithered, variant on that idea...
